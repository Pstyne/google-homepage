I have a pretty good understanding of the concepts that I will practice through this exercise. However, practicing the skills I have learned will be simply to reinforce what I've learned throughout the past year or so to apply to this, as well as, other Odin projects. Hope you enjoy. I will :)

I didn't go for over the top style or anything but it looks good to me. I struggled with a few divs and placements but other than that turned out well.
